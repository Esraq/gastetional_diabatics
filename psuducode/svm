•  Input: Dataset with features (X) and target variable (y).
•  Split Data:
•	Divide dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
•  Standardize Data:
•	Apply standard scaling to features for both training and testing sets.
•  Hyperparameter Tuning:
•	Define a parameter grid with values for C, kernel, and gamma.
•	Use cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) to find the best hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
•  Train the Best Model:
•	Use the optimal hyperparameters to train an SVM classifier on the training data.
•  Make Predictions:
•	Predict class labels and probabilities for the test data.
•  Evaluate the Model:
•	Compute metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
•  Output:
•	Display the evaluation metrics and the best hyperparameters.
