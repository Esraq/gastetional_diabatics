Input: Dataset with features (X) and target variable (y).
Split Data:
Divide dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Initialize GBM Model:
Use parameters like learning rate, number of estimators, and max depth.
Set a random seed for reproducibility.
Train Model:
Iteratively add decision trees, where each tree:
Corrects errors made by the previous trees by focusing on misclassified samples.
Reduces loss using gradient descent.
Make Predictions:
Predict class labels for the test set.
Calculate probabilities for ROC-AUC evaluation.
Evaluate Model:
Compute metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Output:
Display the evaluation metrics for analysis.
